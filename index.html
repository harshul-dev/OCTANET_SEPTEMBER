                        The term DSA stands for Data 
                        Structures and Algorithms. As 
                        the name itself suggests, it 
                        is a combination of two 
                        separate yet interrelated 
                        topics.Data structures are ways to organize and store data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Different types of data structures are suited for different types of applications, and choosing the right data structure can greatly impact the performance of your program.
                        <br>
    Common algorithms include:
    <br>

                        1) Sorting Algorithms: Arrange data in a particular order (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort).
                        <br>
                        2) Searching Algorithms: Find the location of an item in a data structure (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search).
                        <br>
                        3) Dynamic Programming: A method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the results to avoid redundant calculations.
                        <br>
                        4) Greedy Algorithms: Make the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding the global optimum.
                        <br>
                        5) Divide and Conquer: Break down a problem into smaller subproblems, solve each subproblem, and combine their solutions to solve the original problem.

                        HTML stands for HyperText 
                        Markup Language. It is used 
                        to design web pages using 
                        the markup language.
                        HTML is supported by all major web browsers, ensuring that web pages can be viewed on any device or platform without compatibility issues.<br> HTML can be easily integrated with other web technologies like CSS for styling, JavaScript for interactivity, and APIs for dynamic content.                        <br>
                        
                        <h3 class="para">Why HTML is Important:</h3>
                        
<p class="para">1) Structure: It structures the content on web pages, determining how the content is displayed by the browser.
<br>2) Compatibility: HTML is supported by all browsers, making it the universal language for web development.
<br>3) Foundation: HTML is the foundation of web development, often used in conjunction with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for interact.

                        JavaScript (JS) is the most 
                        popular lightweight, interpreted 
                        compiled programming language.JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language primarily used in web development. It's an essential part of the front-end technology stack, alongside HTML and CSS. JavaScript allows developers to create interactive and dynamic web pages by enabling client-side scripting. This means it runs directly in the user's browser without needing to reload the page, allowing for responsive user interfaces and real-time content updates.JavaScript was initially developed to make web pages more interactive. At the time, the web was largely static, and Netscape wanted a scripting language that could run in the browser, enabling dynamic content and user interaction.<br> As Netscape's JavaScript gained popularity, Microsoft created its own version called JScript, included in Internet Explorer 3. This led to a period of browser wars, where different browsers supported different versions of JavaScript, causing compatibility issues.
